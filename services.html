                <h2>Psychotherapy / Counseling for Individuals</h2>
                <p>Psychotherapy is a powerful tool used to relieve emotional pain, explore and understand your thoughts and feelings, and promote personal growth. Psychotherapy is not as some believe, similar to talking to a friend. As a trained professional, I will give you a safe, confidential space to communicate your thoughts in whatever ways feel comfortable to you. Together we will explore deeper questions and figure out what is needed for you to stay more steady and create the kind of life you want. Our work will tap into your strengths. I will not be listening to your problems. I will be listening to your capacity, your desires, your longings, your motivation to be happy and healthy, and wise in your life. I will make sense of what I hear through the lense of theories about the workings of the mind and the origins of psychological problems. My responses might vary from empathic, direct, sometimes practical and other times challenging depending on what I believe you need. In my sessions, I allow a lot of space for the client to hear their own thoughts but I also understand that he or she comes to me for my expertise and I offer my interpretations, thoughts and questions. My stance is direct, non judgmental and respectful.</p>
                <p>I specialize in working with professionals and students who are high achievers and have high expectations. I am passionate about helping you beat stress and anxiety. In addition to treating anxiety, I also provide treatment for depression, relationship difficulties, divorce related issues, stress management and other issues.</p>
                
                <h2>Family Therapy</h2>
                <p>Family therapy is a type of psychotherapy designed to address specific issues that prevent a family from functioning in a healthy way. This kind of psychotherapy focuses on the behaviors of all family members and the way these behaviors affect not only individual family members, but also the relationship between family members and the family unit as a whole.</p>
                <p>In this therapy, I am an advocate for each member of the family and my focus is on promoting the health of the family as a unit while attending to the well being of every member.</p>
                
                <h2>Remote - Online Therapy</h2>
                <p>My recommendation is in person treatment when possible. However, I respect that life is busy. In order to become more accessible to clients who would otherwise be unable to attend treatment in person, I now offer online therapy to clients in the state of New Jersey as well as internationally.</p>
                <p>Clients using online therapy find it a simple and convenient way to work with me either some or all of the time. I use a HIPAA protected virtual platform which works similarly to Facetime but is encrypted to protect your privacy. Before our scheduled session, I will send you a link.</p>
