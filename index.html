                    I help my clients transform into the most confident, connected, and best version of themselves. My areas of focus include anxiety, trauma recovery, relationships, divorce issues, and more. I specialize in innovative and powerful brain-body techniques (Brainspotting) and Mindfullness. Also, depending on my client’s needs, I may combine talk therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT).
                    <br><br>
                    I utilize practical tools, not just theory, to help you identify and remain connected to your feelings. I am direct and straighforward in my approach.
                    <br><br>
                    I bring a unique international perspective to my work. As a European, who has lived and worked in the US for almost 30 years, I understand issues related to cross-cultural living.

                    If below describes you…. Please reach out… I can help…
                    <br><br>
                    You seem to have it all together on the outside. You live by the golden rule, working hard, extending compassion and taking care of everyone but yourself. You conditioned yourself 
                    to say “I am fine” when you know you are not. You feel stuck in negative cycles and perhaps distract yourself from uncomfortable feelings by over working, shopping or drinking too
                    much. You are constantly in survival mode, feeling stressed, anxious, tired, confused and overwhelmed. 
                    <br><br>
                    Imagine what it would feel like to be able to navigate through your rich, complex, and often challenging life with confidence, trust, and the feeling of the wind in your sails. You would see yourself as more competent and know that you have everything inside you to skillfully recognize, respond to, and bounce back from whatever life throws at you.
