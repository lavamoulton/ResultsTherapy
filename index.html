                    You seem to have it all together on the outside.
                    You live by the golden rule, working hard, extending compassion and taking care of everyone but yourself.
                    You conditioned yourself to say "I am fine" when you know you are not
                    You feel stuck in negative cycles and perhaps distract yourself from uncomfortable feelings by over working, shopping or drinking too much.
                    You are constantly in survival mode, feeling stressed, anxious, tired, confused and overwhelmed.
                    <br><br>
                    Imagine what it would feel like to be able to navigate through your rich, complex, and often challenging life with confidence, trust, and the feeling of the wind in your sails.
                    You would see yourself as more competent and know that you have everything inside you to skillfully recognize, respond to, and bounce back from whatever life throws at you.
