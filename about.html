                <h1>Rates & Insurance</h1>
                <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>Your privacy is paramount. Therapy requires a high degree of trust with highly sensitive subject matters discussed in the therapistâ€™s office. The law protects the relationship between a client and a psychotherapist, and information cannot be disclosed without written permission.</p>
                <p>Exceptions include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Suspected child abuse or dependent adult or elder abuse, for which I am required by law to report this to the appropriate authorities immediately.</li>
                    <li>If a client is threatening serious bodily harm to another person/s, I must notify the police and inform the intended victim.</li>
                    <li>If a client intends to harm himself or herself, I will make every effort to enlist their cooperation in ensuring their safety. If they do not cooperate, I will take further measures without their permission that are provided to me by law in order to ensure their safety.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Rates</h2>
                <p><b>Initial Consultation: </b>$150.00</p>
                <p><b>Ongoing Sessions: </b>$120.00</p>
                <p>I accept checks, cash, and major credit cards. Payment is due at each session. A limited number of sliding scale slots are available.</p>
                
                <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
                <p>Cancellations and rescheduling appointments requires 24 hour notice. Cancellations with less than 24 hours require payment in full.</p>
                
                <h2>Insurance</h2>
                <p>I bill all commercial insurance plans as an out of network provider as a free courtesy to clients. Most insurance plans with out-of-network benefits will reimburse you 60-90% of my fee when you submit a claim after the deductible is met. Please note that I make no guarantees about the level of reimbursement from your insurance company and clients are responsible to be informed about their individual benefits.</p>
                <p>Questions to ask insurance for out-of-network reimbursement:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do I have out-of-network benefits for counseling services with a Licensed Professional Counselor for procedure code 90837 or 90834?</li>
                    <li>What portion of the amount paid will I be reimbursed?</li>
                    <li>Do I have a deductible that must be met before insurance will reimburse for my out-of-network sessions?</li>
                    <li>What is the procedure for obtaining reimbursement?</li>
                    <li>Does my plan reimburse for telehealth (online) sessions?</li>
                </ul>
